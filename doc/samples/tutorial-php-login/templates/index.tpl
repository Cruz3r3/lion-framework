The goal of this tutorial is to learn how to use the security framework, to be concrete, we are going to:<br>
<ul><li>Learn how to build a login form and integrate it within the security framework</li>
    <li>Learn how to define roles and permissions</li>
    <li>Learn how to protect pages and sections to be accessible just by authenticated users</li>
</ul>
<br>
The application that we are going to develop will expose a login form, allowing users to authenticate. We're going to also protect some pages in order to be accessible just by users being authenticated.<br>
